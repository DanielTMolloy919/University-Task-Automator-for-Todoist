# University-Task-Automator-for-Todoist

### Explanation

This script creates sets of repeatable tasks and outputs as CSV readable by Todoist. 

Example utility might be to keep a track of the lectures, tutorial sets and quizzes to be done over a uni semester. Everything is categorised by week in the output CSV, meaning it is easy to review any content that may have been missed, e.g. 'I didn't complete the tutorial set in week 4, so I should do that first'.

### Features to be Added
 - CLI/GUI for defining repeatable tasks
 - Allow for only some weeks to be exported to CSV e.g. if the user is already part-way through the semester
